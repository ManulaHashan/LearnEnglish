  <h2>Parts of Speech</h2>

  <p>In English grammar, the eight major parts of speech are noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.</p>
  <h2>Nouns</h2>
  <p>The easy way to remember nouns is that they refer to people, places, or things. Even intangible or abstract concepts like ideas or thoughts are things. In the following sentences, the nouns are highlighted:</p>
  <p><mark class="tool__keyword">Sally</mark>
    doesn’t use an <mark class="tool__keyword">iPhone</mark>
    .
    <mark class="tool__keyword">Jared</mark>
    doesn’t eat <mark class="tool__keyword">subs</mark>
    .
    The <mark class="tool__keyword">Earth</mark>
    is not the <mark class="tool__keyword">center</mark>
    of the <mark class="tool__keyword">universe</mark>
    .</p>
  <h2>Pronouns</h2>
  <p>Pronouns are words that replace nouns: <i>I, me, she, we, they, who, that, yours, his, her,</i> etc.</p>
  <p>Pronouns need antecedents. That means that the thing (or person, or place) that the pronoun refers to needs to have been mentioned already by name somewhere earlier in the sentence or paragraph. If it’s not clear which thing the
    pronoun refers to, the reader can get quite confused.</p>
  <p><mark class="tool__keyword">I</mark>
    swam in the ocean.
    <mark class="tool__keyword">You</mark>
    swam in the ocean.
    <mark class="tool__keyword">He</mark>
    swam in the ocean.
    <mark class="tool__keyword">She</mark>
    swam in the ocean.
    <mark class="tool__keyword">It</mark>
    swam in the ocean.</p>
