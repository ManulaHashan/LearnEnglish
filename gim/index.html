    <h2>Pronouns</h2>

    <h3>What is Pronoun?</h3>

    <p>
      Pronouns replace nouns. A different pronoun is required
      depending on two elements: the noun being replaced and the
      function that noun has in the sentence. In English, pronouns only<br>
      take the gender of the noun they replace in the 3rd person singular form.
      The 2nd person plural pronouns are identical to the 2nd person singular
      pronouns except for the reflexive pronoun
